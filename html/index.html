<h2>Shadow Jago's <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">INSTINCT!</span></h2>
	Shadow Jago can use his instinct for two purposes. The first is Dark Tether. <br>
	Dark Tether to his opponent by hitting them with a fireball or dashing through <br>
	their body. Once tethered to his opponent, pressing HP+HK will instantly generate <br>
	a stock of shadow meter for both Shadow Jago and his opponent. Also while <br>
	tethered, Shadow Jago's surges and shadow moves will require half the amount <br>
	as normal, while draining half of the cost of the move from the opponent's<br>
	shadow meter. The second use of Dark Tether is at any point during his <br>
	instinct, Shadow Jago can "cash out" the remainder of his instinct to perform<br>
	a Raging Demon. The damage of this is reflective of the amount of time left<br>
	in instinct.
